# Credit-Card-Checker

## Aim
To practice intermediate Javascript syntax // Loops & Function 

## Context
The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing! 
  * Starter code : line 1 - 24 (arrays of credit cards)

## Project Requirements

1. * Create a function **`validateCred()`** that has a parameter of an array. 
   * The purpose of **`validateCred()`** is to return `true` when an array contains digits of a valid credit card number and `false` when it is invalid, using the [Luhn's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description). 
   * This function should **NOT** mutate the values of the original array.
 
2. * Create a function **`findInvalidCards()`** that has one parameter for a nested array of credit card numbers. 
   * The role of **`findInvalidCards()`** is to check through the nested array for which numbers are invalid, and return another nested array of invalid cards.
